SRB2P MAIN FILE:

This repository only should have the contents of SRB2P-main.pk3 (this means only lua files)

HOW TO USE GET THE FILE FROM THE REPOSITORY
- After pulling, compress the results of the pull into a .zip file (NOT .rar or 7z, be careful not to include the .git folder)
-   ^ PK3s are in fact just glorified zips!
- Rename the resulting archive to SRB2P-main.pk3
- Move to your SRB2P folder
